\begin{problem}
    Use the MATLAB/Octave function \texttt{primes} to generate all prime numbers between \(1\) and \(10^6\).
    Save the result in a vector \(x\) and create a histogram of these values using the command \texttt{hist(x)}.
    \[
    \text{Plot a histogram of the prime numbers.}
    \]
    \begin{feedback}[correct]
    The function \texttt{primes(10^6)} generates all prime numbers up to \(10^6\). Use the \texttt{hist()} function to visualize the distribution of these numbers.

\begin{problem}
    Analyze the distribution of primes based on the histogram.
    Discuss how the density of primes decreases as numbers grow larger.
    \[
    \text{Provide an analysis of prime density.}
    \]
    \begin{feedback}[correct]
    The density of primes decreases logarithmically as the numbers increase, which aligns with the Prime Number Theorem.
